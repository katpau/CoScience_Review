function  parfor_MainPath(IndexSubjects, SubjectListFile, DESIGN, OUTPUT, OutputFolder, ImportFolder, AnalysisName, SubsetSize, RetryError, LogFolder, ParPools, PrintLocation, StepsToSave)

% for each Subject, carries out all RDF combinatins as defined in
% OUTPUT(a .mat file)
% Output: For each Subject, creates a structure including EEG.Data,
%         Subjectname, StepHistory, InputFile and Miscellaneous
%         applies corresponding step_functions to the data
%         saves final file (or interims) as Subject.mat in a folder
%         with the corresponding step/choice combination, e.g. 1.1_2.3
%
% Inputs
%       IndexSubjects: Integer, to manage parallelization on several nodes; points to subset of data;
%	    SubjectListFile: String, pointing to list of Subjects to be analyzed (completed ones are removed)
%       DESIGN: string, Full FileName (incl. Path) to Structure including all possible Steps and Choices
%       OUTPUT: Kept for keeping function similar to parfor Main Path
%       ImportFolder: String pointing to the Folder that includes all raw files (in BIDS structure)
%       AnalysisName: string, used to decide which events should be
%                       extracted (see Step Function of Bad_Segments and Bad_Epochs
%                       for how this is used).
%       SubsetSize
%       RetryError: string ("0"|"1"). When step was run before and resulted in an error, try
%               stepagain ("1"). Default is "0"
%       OutputFolder: String pointing to the Folder where Data should be saved
%       LogFolder: String pointing to the Folder where Logs should be saved
%       ParPools: String. how many parallel instances of matlab can be
%                    run, Default "16"
%       PrintLocation: string, "1" or "0", some indexes of currently ran
%                  lines can be printed to console if set to 1, Default is "0"
%       Note: All inputs are given as string as these are provided outside
%       Matlab and therefore always parsed as strings.
