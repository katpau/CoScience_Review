%lnGamma Approximate natural logarithm of the Gamma function (C. Lanczos, 1964)
%
%% Syntax
%		lgm = lnGamma(a);
%
%% Description
%   The log-Gamma approximation is based on the method by Lanczos (1964). The 
%   algorithm is computationally fast but, with a relative error of < 2e-10, 
%   less accurate that other methods.
