We hope that you find the software and documentation useful.
If you publish an analysis using the toolbox, we ask that you cite us. 
For now, please cite us via GitHub, but we are currently preparing on a publication to submit to peer review.

# External Dependencies

The code in the toolbox depends on the functionality supplied by [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).
In the future, we hope to offer support for LIBSVM's specialised and often faster cousin, [LIBLINEAR](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/), as well as potentially other backends for other classifiers. 
You need to configure MATLAB to use these external dependencies.
Please see their respective documentation for more information.
