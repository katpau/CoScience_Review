%% Housekeeping

% Clears the workspace and closes all figure windows
clear variables;
close all;




%% Select Subject Datasets and Discrimination Groups (dcgs)

% Set which subjects to include in group analyses.
% Example: sbjs_todo = [1:10] for subject numbers 1 to 10
sbjs_todo = [1:10];

% Enter the discrimination group for classification. 
% Example: dcg_todo = [1]
% Two discrimination groups can be entered as a vector when using cross-condition decoding.
% Example for cross-decoding: dcg_todo = [1, 2]
dcg_todo = [1];

% Was cross-condition decoding performed? 
% 0 = no / 1 = yes
cross = 0;




%% Filepaths and Locations of Subject Datasets

% Enter the name of the study (used for labeling saved decoding results files)
study_name = 'EXAMPLE';

% Base directory path
bdir = '/Desktop/My Study/';

% Output directory (where decoding results have been saved)
output_dir = '/Desktop/My Study/Decoding Results/';




%% EEG Dataset Information

nchannels = 64; % Number of channels
channel_names_file = 'channel_information.mat'; % Name of .mat file containing channel labels and channel locations
channellocs = [bdir, 'Channel Locations/']; % Path of directory containing channel information file (within the base directory)
sampling_rate = 1000; % Data sampling rate in Hz
pointzero = 100; % Corresponds to the time of the event/trigger code relative to the start of the epoch (in ms)




%% Condition and Discrimination Group (dcg) Information

% Label each condition
% Usage: cond_labels{condition number} = 'Name of condition';
% Example: cond_labels{1} = 'Correct Responses';
% Condition label {X} corresponds to data in column X of the single subject
% data arrays.
cond_labels{1} = 'condition_A';
cond_labels{2} = 'condition_B';
cond_labels{3} = 'condition_C';
cond_labels{4} = 'condition_D';
        
% Discrimination groups
% Enter the condition numbers of the conditions to discriminate between
% Usage: dcg{discrimination group number} = [condition 1, condition 2];
% Example: dcg{1} = [2, 3]; to compare conditions 2 and 3 for dcg 1
dcg{1} = [1, 3]; 
dcg{2} = [2, 4]; 
              
% Label each discrimination group
% Usage: dcg_labels{Discrimination group number} = 'Name of discrimination group'
% Example: dcg_labels{1} = 'Correct vs. Error Responses';
dcg_labels{1} = 'A vs. C';
dcg_labels{2} = 'B vs. D';
