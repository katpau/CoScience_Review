% This function requires the following inputs:
% INPUT = structure, containing at least the fields "Data" (containing the
%       EEGlab structure, "StephHistory" (for every forking decision). More
%       fields can be added through other preprocessing steps.
% Choice = string, naming the choice run at this fork (included in "Choices")
%
% This function gives the following output:
% OUTPUT = struct, similiar to the INPUT structure. StepHistory and Data is
%           updated based on the new calculations. Additional fields can be
%           added below
